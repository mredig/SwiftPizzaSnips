# SwiftPizzaSnips

This is simply a collection of common utility functions I use in many/most projects. I got tired of having to write them every time.

A note on `#if canImport(FoundationNetworking)` - Instead of doing `#if os(Linux)`, I often use foundation networking instead as a means of capturing all non apple platforms.
